Let’s say you're grouping by book.id. That means you want one row per book.
But if a book has multiple authors or multiple genres, those values differ across rows —
and without aggregation, you’d get duplicate rows for the book.

So, we use GROUP_CONCAT to combine those multiple author or genre values into a single string,
preserving the one-row-per-book structure.
